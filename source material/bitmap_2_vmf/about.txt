This script was used in this project for creating a basic map with a network of 
basic systems. It references a set of bitmaps to do this. The purpose and way to
use each bitmap is explained below:

map.bmp

	This file describes the general layout of the map.
	
	Currently each pixel represents 64 units in hammer, meaning a regular
	hallway of 256 units can be represented by a hallway 4 pixels wide.
	
	The script will ignore black pixels. It will group together pixels of the
	same color and will use those groups to create brushes in the output file.
	This can be useful for designating hallways and rooms. Also, each brush is
	designated a visgroup based on the color of the pixel.
